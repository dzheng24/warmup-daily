// Using spread and destructuring assignment, create a new array called newPeople, which is a copy of the people array, with a person named ‘Odie’ added to the beginning and one named ‘Garfield’ added to the end.


// Using spread and destructuring assignment, create a new object called newStuff, which is a copy of the stuff object, with a new car added to the end of the cars array within it


// Create a state object with keys of people and stuff that contain the people and stuff data.
// Do this using object destructuring assignment


// Using spread and destructuring assignments, create a new object called newState, repeating the newPeople and newStuff steps above but directly within the people and stuff nodes of the state object (don’t just spread in newPeople and newStuff)


// Prove that the original people, stuff, and state are unchanged.
